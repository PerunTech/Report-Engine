/**
 * The production bundle: one UMD file, `backend/www/report-engine.js`.
 *
 * The backend registers every plugin under a context path and the shell fetches
 * it from `/<context>/<file>.js`, then reads the routes off `window[<context>]`,
 * so the format and the global's name are the contract. Both halves are in
 * package.json.
 *
 * `perun-core` is the shell's, published as a window global by its own bundle,
 * and is never bundled -- in dev as well as production, so dev catches problems
 * that would otherwise appear only after deployment.
 *
 * `pnpm dev` serves the same file, rebuilt on every save, behind the shell the
 * way a deployment serves it -- see build/dev-server.mjs.
 *
 * `.mjs` because this package has no `type` field, so a `.js` here would be read
 * as CommonJS.

 * from its extension -- so the parser refuses the first tag it meets. Renaming
 * the files to `.jsx` would put a rename into every blame on them, so
 * the language is stated here instead, for this repository's own source only.
 *
 * Classic JSX: `React.createElement`, with React imported from perun-core. The
 * automatic runtime would import `react/jsx-runtime`, which is not installed
 * here and would be a second React if it were.
