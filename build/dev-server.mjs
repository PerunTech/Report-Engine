 * Bundling it instead does not work: perun-core's package entry is a full,

 * reasons, and the first is not a convenience: perun-core code-splits with
 * chunkFilename '[name].perun-core.js', but only the entry chunk is committed,
 * so the installed package asks for chunks that were never published. A local
 * build has them. The second is the dev loop -- rebuild perun-core next door
 * and reload this page, with no publish and no reinstall in between.
 *
 * The checkout is also the fallback when the package is not installed at all,
